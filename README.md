# SAMPL4
Archived input files from the SAMPL4 challenge

## Challenge overview
SAMPL4 was organized by David L. Mobley and collaborators.

The SAMPL4 evaluation was carried out from May to September 2013, and discussed at a workshop held at Stanford University in September, 2013.

The participants were required to predict **hydration free energy**, **host-guest interaction** and **protein-ligand binding**.

## SAMPL4 special issues
The papers covering the results of the challenge were published in two special issues of Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design, one dedicated to [hydration free energy](https://link.springer.com/journal/10822/volumes-and-issues/28-3) and the second to [host-guest and protein-ligand binding](https://link.springer.com/journal/10822/volumes-and-issues/28-4).
