This directory contains various files relating to host-guest affinity calculations for CB7:

- CucurbitIntro2013: Introduction to what's known about CB7, provided by Michael Gilson
- Sampl4 Compounds Final.pdf: Description of the experimental protocol and 2D structures of the guests. This is the definitive reference for compounds. Note these are shown as the salt form which was actually tested. Note that we here refer to the two isomers of 11 as 11a and 11b as shown in the structure files and SMILES
- cucurbit_7_uril.mol2: Structure of the CB7 host provided by Michael Gilson
- CB7_smiles.txt: SMILES strings and names (following Sampl4 Compounds Final.pdf) of the compounds, provided for convenience and built from their 2D structures by the Mobley lab
- mol2files, sdffiles: Possible 3D conformers for the guests, with expected protonation states as noted in the CucurbitIntro2013 file, as generated by the Mobley lab. These are provided for convenience without warranty and in no particular frame of reference; use these (with inspection) at your own risk. Please note that the fact that some of these appear within the host is purely a coincidence and these are not designed as starting conformations for simulations.
- predictions.txt: Template file for submission of relative binding free energy predictions (please give $\Delta \Delta G$ values relative to guest 1, p-xylenediammonium).

As noted in the introduction, we provide no warranty about protonation state of these molecules in solution or when bound, so you may wish to consider multiple possible protonation states, especially in cases where you don't believe positive charge is being stabilized by favorable interactions. (I am writing this without any experience in the system and any knowledge of the experiments, so take this as a disclaimer rather than a hint).

Some other things you need to know:
1) Some of these molecules may have multiple stable conformations in solution, which may be separated by substantial energy barriers. You are advised to treat such cases with care.
2) A template for submission of your results is provided in the base directory
3) We ask for predicted uncertainties in your results as well as confidence value. These are expected to be used for different information; the predicted uncertainty should likely be something like the standard error in the mean for your computed free energy, given your particular method and parameters. For example, for an MD-based free energy calculation we might arrive at a value of perhaps 0.1 kcal/mol given the particular force field and amount of simulation time. The confidence level should reflect your relative confidence that this particular prediction is correct, so if you are skeptical about your force field's parameters for bridged rings, for example, you might assign a lower confidence to those compounds. We plan to factor confidence estimates into (at least one version of) the final scoring, in that penalties will be less for being wrong on low confdience compounds (but rewards will also be less for being right on them).
4) Note that compound 11 is a racemic mixture of two isomers. SMILES strings of both (11a and 11b) are provided for your convenience, as well as structure files.
