This directory contains various files relating to host-guest affinity calculations for OctaAcid:

- OctaAcidIntro: Introduction to what's known about OctaAcid, provided by Bruce Gibb
- Sampl4 Componds Final.pdf: Description of the experimental protocol and 2D structures of the guests. Note that affinities are being measured by ITC and NMR. This is the definitive reference for the compounds.
- Octa-Acid_neg6.mol2, Octa-Acid_neg8.mol2: Structure of Octa Acid host provided by Bruce Gibb as .pdb and converted to .mol2 by the Mobley lab. This is provided with charge -8 and charge -6 as per note 3 below. 
- OctaAcid_smiles.txt: SMILES strings and names (following Sampl4 Compounds Final.pdf) of the compounds, provided for convenience and built from their 2D structures by the Mobley lab.
- mol2files, sdffiles: Possible 3D conformers for the guests, with expected protonation states as noted in the OctaAcidIntro file, as generated by the Mobley lab. These are provided for convenience without warranty and in no particular frame of reference; use these (with inspection) at your own risk.
- predictions.txt: Template file for submission of standard binding free energy predictions (please give $\Delta G^\circ$ values in kcal/mol).

We provide no warranty about the protonation state of these molecules in solution or when bound, though the pH is such that they are expected to be fully deprotonated in solution, and the Gibb lab and collaborators believe they are also deprotonated when bound in order to prevent capsule dimerization. Without any knowledge of this specific system, though, if I were participating, I would want to double-check that neutral carboxylic acids don't show favorable binding as well. (I say this without any knowledge of the results and any experience on the system, as a disclaimer rather than a hint.)

Some other things you need to know:
1) A template for submission of your results is provided in the base directory
2) We ask for predicted uncertainties in your results as well as confidence value. These are expected to be used for different information; the predicted uncertainty should likely be something like the standard error in the mean for your computed free energy, given your particular method and parameters. For example, for an MD-based free energy calculation we might arrive at a value of perhaps 0.1 kcal/mol given the particular force field and amount of simulation time. The confidence level should reflect your relative confidence that this particular prediction is correct, so if you are skeptical about your force field's parameters for chlorines, for example, you might assign a lower confidence to those compounds. We plan to factor confidence estimates into (at least one version of) the final scoring, in that penalties will be less for being wrong on low confdience compounds (but rewards will also be less for being right on them).
3) The charge of the OctaAcid host is not completely clear. The experiments are done at high pH, so it is probably fully deprotonated (charge -8). However, some suggest the charge should be -6, with two of the carboxylic acids at the bottom of the basket being protonated to allow for hydrogen bonding (see Ewell, Gibb, and Rick, J. Phys. Chem. B 112(33):10272 (2008).
