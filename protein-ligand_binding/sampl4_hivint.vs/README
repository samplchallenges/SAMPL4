This directory contains input files relating to the HIV integrase "virtual screening" challenge. For this portion of the challenge, your job is to recognize binders among a set of nonbinders. In this case the full set is between 300-400 compounds. You should rank-order compounds based on how well you think they will bind, and also submit a "yes/no" prediction for each (on whether or not it binds).

Please be sure to read this file, as the instructions here are vital to your successful participation in the challenge.

Contents of this directory include:
- ligands: Directory containing .sdf and .mol2 files of all of the molecules in question here. Molecule file names and titles are the codes we use here for identifying ligands. Please note that .sdf files use a format where aromatics are shown with alternating single/double bonds, while .mol2 files identify aromatics separately. These are intended to provide your input files for predictions. Please note no partial charges are provided; you will need to assign these (if you need them) via your method of choice. 
- final_fullset.txt: (For your information) A listing of molecule base names (first column), molecule titles as in the files (second column), and SMILES strings (third column) for all molecules in the set.
- 3nf8_reference.pdb: 3NF8 structure from the PDB, aligned to the frame of reference we are using here for predictions. This particular structure happens to have ligands in all of the binding sites of interest here, and so is particularly useful. We also use this to identify *which* binding sites you should focus on, as we describe below. 
- README: This README file
- HIV_Integrase_Intro.pdf: Writeup providing an introduction to this binding site.
- template.txt: Template file for submission of predictions

Your submission should provide a ranked list molecules, from predicted best to worst, along with a confidence estimate for each entry and a prediction in terms of binder vs nonbinder. See the template file for further details. Pose prediction is not necessary at this stage, though this may be done for the next stage of the challenge. If you would like the submission template file for that, let us know and we can provide it in advance. 

Please note that many compounds are stereoisomers of one another, and typically all stereoisomers were tested. These are present as separate entries in the set -- for example, AVX38673 has two stereoisomers, AVX38673_0 and AVX-38673_1. One, both, or neither may be binders, so each is present as a separate entry in the set and you can treat these as separate compounds. Typically there are substantial structural differences between the stereoisomers. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
All ligand protonation/tautomer states are provided "as is" without any warranty. You may wish to consider multiple possible protonation or tautomeric states for different ligands, as these can change in solution and in the binding site. For the pose prediction challenge, we will provide some pointers about possible protonation states/tautomers to pay particular attention to, but here the number of compounds is larger. So, we have provided protonation/tautomer states as assigned by OpenEye's toolkits (for pH 7) with no further investigation. If protonation or tautomer states are likely to be particularly important for your method, you may want to do further investigation yourself.

A BIT ON THE PROTEIN:
The protein structure is a dimer, so there are essentially two equivalent versions of each binding site here. There are three main binding sites in this protein, so really six binding sites in th edimer. For the pose prediction portion of the challenge, we have selected just one of each site for the purposes of judging binding mode prediction (though this is likely not important here). Specifically, the sites we plan on judging (the three unique sites) are (in 3NF8) those occupied by the ligand with residue name CDQ: (a) The Y3 site: residue number 257 chain B; (b) The fragment site: residue number 277 chain A; and (c) the LEDGF site: residue number 267, chain A. If you are using a method which requires specifying a binding site, we suggest you focus your efforts on these regions of the protein (as opposed to the equivalent binding sites on the other side of the dimer), as we plan to judge predictions in these sites.

We recognize that the presence of three different binding sites may be a deterrent to some who would prefer to focus on predicting binding modes given knowledge of the likely binding site. To aid these people, we will give the hint that many (though by no means all) of the ligands bind in the LEDGF site, so if you like, you can focus just on that site and still do relatively well. If enough people do this, we may also add a separate scoring category for those who do so.
