Docking was done separately to all 3 binding sites (257, 267, 277)
Assuming the affinities for all 3 were equal (almost surely not the case),
the individual ligands were assigned to whichever binding site they scored
the best to with automated docking with DOCK3.7, resulting in a single
merged list of ranks, affinities and poses.
