DOCK3.7 automated docking was used on 3nf7, aligned to 3nf8. A single binding
site was used here (the same as used in DUD-E). Since the structure has only
been aligned and then automated docking was used again, only grid errors
should contribute to differences in docking, but poses can be submitted for
this run whereas they cannot be submitted for the other run.

Examining the runs, there are many differences due to just alignment of the PDB
code (much to my surprise!)
