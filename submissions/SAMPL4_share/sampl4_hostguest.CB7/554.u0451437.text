Metadynamics was used to find the standard state relative free energy of binding among 14 different host-guest systems. Simulations were performed using Gromacs software version 4.6.1 compiled with Plumed patch. Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) and AMBER 99 SB potential was used for all atoms, bonds, angles and torsion parameters. The system was solvated using the TIP4P water model. The metadynamics calculations were performed in the NPT ensemble applying periodic boundary conditions to all axis. The pressure was kept constant to 1 bar and the temperature was kept to 298 K. Both algorithms used the Berendsen weak coupling scheme.
