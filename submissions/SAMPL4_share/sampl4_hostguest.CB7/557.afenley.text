Differences in enthalpy upon host-guest complexion were estimated using explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations in an NPT ensemble with water models TIP3P and TIP4PEW. The General Amber Force Field 1.4 (GAFF) was used to assign all bonded and vdW terms to the host and guests. Partial atomic charges were assigned to the host and guests using AM1-BCC. Starting structures in the bound state were chosen as the lowest free energy conformations as determined via the QM/M2 methodology. The total energy of a given simulation, including all water-water and water-solute interactions, was used as the absolute enthalpy of the system. Binding enthalpies were calculated as the difference between the absolute enthalpy of the complex along with the absolute enthalpy of liquid water and the absolute enthalpy of the host with the absolute enthalpy of the free guest (H_complex + H_water - H_host - H_guest). Care was taken such that the total count of explicit water molecules is equal between the bound and unbound states. Each simulation was a microsecond in length with snapshots taken every 2picoseconds resulting in 500,000 energy measurements per simulation. Block averaging reports a standard error of the mean of the absolute enthalpies to be within 0.16 kcal/mol for all of the simulations resulting in a combined error estimate of the binding enthalpy to be 0.3 kcal/mol per binding calculation. Eight host-guest pairs with known ITC data were used as a training set to fit the computed enthalpies to the enthalpies and the free energies reported by ITC. The resulting fit curves are applied to the SAMPL4 host-guest data set as a method for predicting the free energy of binding using computed enthalpies.
