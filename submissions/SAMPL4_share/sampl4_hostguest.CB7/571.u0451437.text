Chemical intuition was used to rank the molecules based upon their binding affinities. Characteristics such as estimated charge, size, and rigidity of the molecules were taken into account. This was primarily done as a precursor to running computational analysis on these host-guest systems. No actual energies were calculated and no CPUs were used. The molecules were strictly ranked.
