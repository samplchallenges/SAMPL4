#Selective data in these papers were used to construct a training set of CB7 ligands for comparing simulated and experimentally determined binding affinities.  Free energies of binding were computed for guests B2, B5, A1, A2, A3, and A5 in Moghaddam, 2011, and were directly compared to the binding free energies found there.  All ligands found in Wyman, 2008 were also used in the training set, with simulated binding free energies compared to those calculated from the provided equilibrium constants.  To generate mol2 files for all of these ligands we used the "Online SMILES Translator and Structure File Generator" freely available from NCI at the following website: http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/translate/.  Some ligands, especially those found in the Moghaddam papers, are extremely similar to those in SAMPL4, however no ligands used in the training set were the same as those in the competition. For the relative binding free energies shown, the training set was only used as a guideline for accuracy in determining the error, which is the RMSE of the simulated binding free energies of the training set ligands from the experimental values.
