#Experimental data used:
#The binding free energy value for guest 6 reported is the experimental value
#reported by Sun et al. Supramolecular Chemistry, 20, 141 (2008). The
#computed binding free energy value for this guest is -5.33 kcal/mol,
#very similar to the experimental value.
#The binding free energy protocol was retrospectively validated on the systems 
#reported in the same study.
