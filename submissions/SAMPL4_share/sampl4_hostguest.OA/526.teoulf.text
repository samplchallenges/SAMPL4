OA/FEP/RESP
Relative affinities calculated with free-energy perturbation.
Host-guest complexes simulated in explicit TIP3P solvent.
GAFF force field used for the host and the guest, using RESP charges (based on HF/6-31G* QM calculations and ESP points sampled with the Merz-Kollman scheme), obtained by antechamber.
~5000 atoms for host-guest, ~1600 atoms for host.
Periodic-boundary NPT calculations using truncated octahedral boxes and electrostatic interactions treated by particle-mesh Ewald summation.
T=300K, p=1 atm.
Cut-off for non-bonded = 8 Å.
Both host and guest fully charged (total charge -9).
Amber 11 software.
Time step 2 fs (H atoms constrained with SHAKE).
2 ns equilibration and 4 ns production for each lambda value.
Energies evaluated every 10 ps (400 in total).
Free energies calculated with Bennett acceptance ratio, evaluated by PYMBAR.
13 lambda values (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99).
Dual-topology. Electrostatics and van der Waals interactions changed simultaneously, using soft-core potentials for both interactions for disappearing atoms.
10 independent simulations (with different starting velocities).

Absolute energies calculated by using experimental data for guest 6 = -5.04 kcal/mol [H. Sun, C. L. D. Gibb, B. C. Gibb, Supramol. Chem. 20 (2008) 141].
Estimated standard error of experimental data: 0.25 kcal/mol.
Standard errors of the relative affinities: 0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.08, 0.04, 0.18, 0.16 kcal/mol.
