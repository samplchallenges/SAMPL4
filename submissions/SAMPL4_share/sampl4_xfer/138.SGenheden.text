System setup: 3D-dimensional structure of compounds was built from SMILES using UCSF Chimera, and checked manually. Compounds described with GAFF with AM1-BCC charges. For compounds 1 to 4, and 23 to 31 between five and 10 random conformations were generated with MOE. For compounds 6 to 11, 33 to 35, and 37, initial conformations were generated that either contained an intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bond. Compounds were solvated in a box of TIP4P water molecules extending at least 10 Å from the solute.  

Free energy estimates. Solvation free energies was estimated with replica-exchange thermodynamic integration (RETI) using 24 lambda-values. Dual topology with soft-core potentials was used, and the solute electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were decoupled from the surrounding simultaneously. For some compounds a temperature ladder of 20 temperatures was added to the end-points (lambda=0 and 1) and temperature replica-exchange was performed between neighboring temperatures, concurrently with the Hamiltonian replica-exchange between the different lambda windows. 

Simulations: All simulations was performed with a modified version of ProtoMS 2.2 at 300 K. Solvent, solute and box moves were performed with 90%, 9% and 1%, respectively. For the solvent, only translational and rotational moves were attempted. For the solute, all torsions and angles were sampled except in aromatics rings. Bonds were kept fixed at the force field minimum. The cut-off was set 10 Å. The simulations consisted of 5 M equilibration steps before replica-exchange were initiated and 20 M equilibration steps with replica-exchange. This was followed by 30 M steps with data collection. Between 5 and 20 independent simulations were performed for each compound. 

QM/MM correction: 300 snapshots were extracted at lambda=0 from each independent simulations. Single-point energy calculations was performed with Gaussian09. The solute was described at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory and all solvent molecules within the simulation cut-off was included as point charges. The difference between the QM/MM energy and the MM electrostatic energy was then used with the Zwansig formula to compute a QM/MM correction.
