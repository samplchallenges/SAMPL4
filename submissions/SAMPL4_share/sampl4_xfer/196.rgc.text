Methods used here are very similar to the ZINC Processing Pipeline 
published as Irwin et al 2012 in JCIM. However, we have made use of 
Chemaxon's Marvin as a replacement for EPIK for protonation / 
tautomerization. Corina & OMEGA are used to make 3D conformations and 
AMSOL is used to actually get hydration free energies. This method is 
not very exhaustive or extensive (estimated time per compound is 10 
seconds total, which is likely an overestimate), but is simply provided 
as a benchmark to see how well the transfer free energies in our current 
docking protocol compare to measured energies, and as a baseline for better,
more extensive methods to show improvement against.

In this submission, each compound generated contains predictions generated
by taking the mean of the hydration calculation from AMSOL for each conformation
generated by OMEGA in the course of docking database generation.
