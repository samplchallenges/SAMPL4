#The results from the following steps:

#Total combined calculation time on single core: 25 sec

This is hopefully an improvement on my usual submission because the OMEGA calculation now samples hydrogen positions on hydroxyl and amines.  The total time is still slightly less than 0.5 sec/molecule.
